The player decides to try and go for a large straight 1,2,3,4,5. Setting aside 1, 2, 3 and roll again hoping to get 4 and 5.<br><br> Player click on the dice the wish to keep. It will be grayed out and saved the next time they roll. If you decide to no longer keep the dice, you can click the dice again to unsave.</p>
